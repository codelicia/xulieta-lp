# Good Program

Let's begin by opening the PHP tag on our program

```php
<?php
```

after that, we can start to execute php code

```php
echo "Hello Mom! I'm doing Literate Programing in PHP" . PHP_EOL;
```

we can also try more complex things

```php
$i=0;

for (;$i<10;$i++) {
    echo "Counting $i" . PHP_EOL;
}

$i=50;
```

Tangled codes are shared

```php
echo "Last time I checked \$i was $i" . PHP_EOL;
```
