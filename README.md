ðŸ“š Xulieta - Literate programming
=================================

[Literate programming][1] is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in
which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language,
such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code,
from which compilable source code can be generated. The approach is used in scientific
computing and in data science routinely for reproducible research and open access
purposes. Literate programming tools are used by millions of programmers today.
